== Preface

This is the reference manual of *MoonChipmunk*, which is a 
https://www.lua.org[*Lua*] binding library for Scott Lembcke's 
http://chipmunk-physics.net/[*Chipmunk2D*] physics engine.
footnote:[
This manual is written in
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc], rendered with
http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] and a CSS from the
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory[AsciiDoctor Stylesheet Factory].]

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with both Chipmunk2D and the Lua programming language.

For convenience of reference, this document contains external (deep) links to the 
https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html[Lua Reference Manual] and the 
http://chipmunk-physics.net/documentation.php[Chipmunk2D Documentation].

=== Getting and installing

For installation intructions, refer to the README file in the 
https://github.com/stetre/moonchipmunk[*MoonChipmunk official repository*]
on GitHub.

=== Module organization

The MoonChipmunk module is loaded using Lua's 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-require[require]() and
returns a table containing the functions it provides 
(as usual with Lua modules). This manual assumes that such
table is named *cp*, i.e. that it is loaded with:

[source,lua,indent=1]
----
cp = require("moonchipmunk")
----

but nothing forbids the use of a different name.

=== Examples

Complete examples can be found in the *examples/* directory of the release package.

=== License

MoonChipmunk is released under the *MIT/X11 license* (same as
http://www.lua.org/license.html[Lua], and with the same only requirement to give proper
credits to the original author). 
The copyright notice is in the LICENSE file in the base directory
